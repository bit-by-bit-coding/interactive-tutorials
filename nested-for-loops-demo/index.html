      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        A for loop executes the code block inside its body during each cycle of the loop. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We may let the code block be whatever we want depending on the task at hand; sometimes the code block may contain another for loop, this is called <em>nested for loops</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a pair of nested for loops, the inner for loop completely runs itself during each cycle of the outer loop. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-box">
      <div class="flex-col section">
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine if we want to know the favorite movie of each bit by bot below. 
          One of the most straight forward ways to accomplish this goal is to start from the first column, ask the bots sitting in each row, 
          then move on to the next column, until we have recorded the favorite movies of every bot. 
        </p>

      <div class="flex-col section">
        <h2>Example Code</h2>
        <p>
          Let's try to capture this method in code. Since, on the big picture, we ask the bots column by column, 
          the outer for loop should correspond to the number of columns, which is 4. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Then for each column, we ask each bot row by row, 
          so the inner for loop corresponds to the number of rows, which is 3. 
          The code block of the inner loop is where we ask the bot sitting at that position.

        <h2>Quick exercise</h2>
        <p>
          Nested for loops sometimes can consist more than 2 for loops. 
          But as long as you pay attention to the hierarchy of the construct, they are not more difficult to understand.

          See if you can figure out the console output of the following code. <br>

            try computing the answer using mathematical tricks!
