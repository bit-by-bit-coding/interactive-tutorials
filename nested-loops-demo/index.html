      <h2>The concept of Nested For Loops</h2>
      <p>
        A for loop executes the code block inside its body during each cycle of the loop. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We may let the code block be whatever we want depends on the task at hand; sometimes the code block may contain another for loop, this is called <em>nested for loops</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a pair of nested for loops, the inner for loop completely runs itself during each cycle of the outer loop. 
      </p>

        <p>
          Imagine a class of 12, sitting in 3 rows and 4 columns and their teacher wants to know the favorite movie of each student. 
          One of the most straight forward ways to accomplish this goal is to start from the first column, ask the students sitting in each row, 
          then move on to the next column, until we have recorded the favorite movies of every student. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's try to capture this method in code. Since, on the big picture, the teacher carries out this method column by column, 
          the outer for loop should correspond to the number of columns, which is 4. Then for each column, the teacher asks each student row by row, 
          so the inner for loop corresponds to the number of rows, which is 3. The code block of the inner loop is where the teacher asks the student sitting at that position.

        <span class="comment"> &emsp; &emsp; // Here is the code block that does the<br>

        <p>
          Nested for loops sometimes can consist more than 2 for loops. 
          But as long as you pay attention to the hierarchy of the construct, they are not more difficult to understand.
